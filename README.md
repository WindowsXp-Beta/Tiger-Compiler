# Tiger Compiler in C++

## overview

A C++ implementation of tiger compiler.
> Real C++, using many new features of c++11 and later.
>
> I try to make the best use of the framework (never reinvent wheels, use new C++ features as far as I can, etc)
>
> Thanks to all the TAs for providing such a good framework.

**It's a really good project, giving you a full insight into a modern compiler and significantly improving your debug ability, so DO IT YOURSELF.**

**You may refer to this repo, but never COPY.** 

**Like someone(@ [Gun9niR](https://github.com/Gun9niR/Gun9niR)) said, "It benefits you not for the scores, but for the thoughts and efforts you put into them."**

  > I use mark and sweep to implenment a simple garbage collector. However, due to the guide of this lab, I can't push my codes to any public places, so if you want to know the details you can directly CONTACT me by email.

## Usage

If you want to use it to compile your tiger codes. You may refer to README in branch tiger-compiler to see how to compile it.
